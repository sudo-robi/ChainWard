# ChainWard V3.0: Interactive Demo Script (5-7 Minutes)

This script is designed for a live presentation where you "Talk" while performing "Actions" in the frontend.

| Time | Segment | Talk (The Script) | Action (The Interactives) |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **0:00** | **Intro** | "Welcome to ChainWard. We built the first autonomous watchdog for Arbitrum Orbit chains. It doesn't just watch for problems; it fixes them." | Open `https://chain-ward-man.vercel.app/`. Toggle **Dark/Light Mode** 🌙 to show UI polish. |
| **1:00** | **Dashboard** | "This is your Command Center. We're seeing real-time health metrics—block times, sequencer status, and a permanent audit trail of every network event." | Scroll through **Chain Health** and **Incident History**. Hover over status badges. |
| **2:00** | **Incentives** | "We align security with profit. Node operators stake a bond to participate. Here, they can manage their stake and claim yield earned from maintaining uptime." | Go to **Operator Management**. **Connect Wallet**. Click **Admin: Inject Yield**, then click **Claim** on the yield badge. |
| **3:00** | **Simulation** | "Let's break the chain. I'll trigger a 'Critical' Block Lag incident. Watch how the autonomous layer reacts instantly." | Go to **Simulate Incident**. Select **P1**. Click `⚠ Simulate Block Lag`. Show the transaction confirmed in the **Live execution log**. |
| **4:00** | **Autonomy** | "There it is. The system detected the lag and automatically triggered a repair. See the **⚡ AUTO-MITIGATED** badge? That happened without a human." | Point to the new incident in history. Click **Inspect (TX)** to show 11 atomic on-chain logs. |
| **5:00** | **Governance** | "Admins can override the autopilot. We can adjust thresholds like 'Max Block Lag' on the fly to tune the system's sensitivity." | Go to **Response & Governance**. Click **Update Thresholds**. Click **Validate Incident**. Finally, click **Resolve Latest Incident**. |
| **6:00** | **Analytics** | "Finally, we prove reliability over time. Our Analytics show the MTTR and Autonomy Rate—critical metrics for trust and compliance." | Go to **Real-Time Analytics**. Click **Refresh Metrics**. Click **Export CSV** to show the data reporting utility. |
| **7:00** | **Close** | "ChainWard turns incident response into an autonomous, profitable workflow. It's security that pays for itself. Thank you." | Return to **Multi-Chain Fleet** to show the scale of the system. |
